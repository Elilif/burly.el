This package provides tools to save and restore frame and window
configurations in Emacs, including buffers that may not be live anymore.
In this way, it’s like a lightweight "workspace" manager, allowing you
to easily restore one or more frames, including their windows, the
windows’ layout, and their buffers.

   Internally it uses Emacs’s bookmarks system to restore buffers to
their previous contents and location.  This provides power and
extensibility, since many major modes already integrate with Emacs’s
bookmarks system.  However, in case a mode’s bookmarking function isn’t
satisfactory, Burly allows the user to customize buffer-restoring
functions for specific modes.

   For Org mode, Burly provides such custom functions so that narrowed
and indirect Org buffers are properly restored, and headings are located
by outline path in case they’ve moved since a bookmark was made (the
org-bookmark-heading (https://github.com/alphapapa/org-bookmark-heading)
package also provides this through the Emacs bookmark system, but users
may not have it installed, and the functionality is too useful to not
include here by default).

   Internally, buffers and frame/window configurations are also encoded
as URLs, and users may also save and open those URLs instead of using
Emacs bookmarks.  (The name "Burly" comes from "buffer URL.") For
example, a URL to the Installation/Quelpa heading in this file, as I’m
writing it, looks like this:

emacs+burly+file:///home/me/src/emacs/burly.el/README.org?pos=2651&outline-path=%28%22Installation%22%20%22Quelpa%22%29&relative-pos=308

   In terms of built-in features, Burly may be seen as integrating the
built-in libraries bookmark.el and frameset.el, while also replacing and
improving on some of the functionality of desktop.el.
